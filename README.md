# VehicleRegistrationManagement
A .net program with Simple algorithms and file i/o.

Stores number plates into a list. They then can then be edited, tagged or deleted. While making it, I learnt how to use bitwise operators with the byte datatype, in order to control what buttons are enabled/disabled and when.
